# Digital Control Lab
This repository contains the source code for a lab project on digital control, specifically involving an STM32 microcontroller and a DC motor.

## Sessions
### Session 1
In this session, we wrote a simple program that toggles the state of an LED on the STM32 board. We also set up an external interrupt on pin PB3 to change the blinking rate of the LED.

### Session 2 - Phase 1
In this session, we continued working with external interrupts and timers. We set up an interrupt on pin PB3 to start and stop a timer, and we also set up another timer to generate an interrupt at a fixed frequency.

### Session 2 - Phase 2
In this phase of session 2, we modified the code to use a different GPIO pin and timer for generating the interrupt.

### Session 3
In this session, we worked on controlling the speed and direction of a DC motor using pulse-width modulation (PWM) and quadrature encoders. We also measured the speed and position of the motor.

### Session 4
In this session, we used the step response of the motor to determine the motor's parameters (k and tau) using a method known as "system identification."
